# pyspark-example-workbooks

A repository of example PySpark workbooks referred to at my blog https://justinmatters.co.uk/wp

Unfortunately it turns out that Databricks community edition claims that you can easily share workbooks are somewhat overblown. You can share the workbooks but they only remain shared for 6 months so I am putting copies here.
